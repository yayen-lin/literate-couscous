CS400, Spring 2020

In 2015 I came to the US to study.

My family sent me here on one condition: that I study medicine and become a doctor, so that I can take up the family business back home after I graduate. But being in the best medical program in the US, I didn't feel like I was on top of the world, because it was not my decision to come here. 

Calling back to the past where he was triggered by a well-designed website, this was the first time I felt in love with computer technology. In order to become a expert, my parent compromised and sent to learning tachnology design during my spare time. 

But now, I goet into the university and I had to decide for my future career. Whether to become a doctor or to pursue my interest made me headache. 

All this changed after I got into CS400. 

Proffessor Deppeler is really nice and good at explaining everything. With well-structured lecture notes and delightful lectures, I am intrigued by data structure and computer algorithms. 

I start to realize that choosing Computer Science may not only be an action of rebelion or passion that fades away over time. I want to learn more about Computer Science. 

I want to code better, speak in computer languages, think like a computer scientist, and witness the huge changes information technology is bringing to this world. 

Studying Computer Science does not only provide work oppurtunities in the future, but also broadens my horizon. I am here to witness history.
