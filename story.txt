CS400, Spring 2020

In 2015 I came to the US to study.

My family sent me here on one condition: that I study medicine and become a doctor, so that I can take up the family business back home after I graduate. But being in the best medical program in the US, I didn't feel like I was on top of the world, because it was not my decision to come here. 

Calling back to the past where he was triggered by a well-designed website, this was the first time I felt in love with computer technology. In order to become a expert, my parent compromised and sent to learning tachnology design during my spare time. 

But now, I goet into the university and I had to decide for my future career. Whether to become a doctor or to pursue my interest made me headache. 

All this changed after I got into CS400.
